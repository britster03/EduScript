# EduScript: A Domain-Specific Programming Language for Educational Robotics

## **Introduction**

EduScript is a simplified programming language designed to make programming educational robots accessible and engaging for beginners. By providing intuitive commands and control structures, EduScript bridges the gap between complex programming languages and the educational needs of robotics learners.

## **Features**

- **Simple Syntax**: Easy-to-read and write commands tailored for robotics.
- **Control Structures**: Supports conditionals (`if-else`) and loops (`repeat`).
- **Robotic Commands**: Predefined actions like `moveForward`, `turnRight`, `pickUpObject`, etc.
- **Sensor Integration**: Interact with simulated sensors like `detectObstacle`.
- **Simulation Environment**: Visual representation of robot movements using Pygame.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git (optional)

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EduScript.git
   cd EduScript
